This project comes from Round Two of the inaugural Rice × Syracuse Analytics Competition. Our team was tasked with building an original expected Batting Average metric using stadium dimensions, and I had the opportunity to serve as team captain. I’m grateful to my teammates, Jacob Andreini and Ethan Larimore, for their collaboration and insight.
